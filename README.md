# Tacocat
PowerShell host enumeration script originally created by @WiredPulse

Added features:
- Created all calls into functions and created a menu option to select which functions user runs
- Modified flow to allow for better process and netstat enumeration
- Added a function to enumerate running processes and hash the running .exe and .dll files
